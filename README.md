# d6t-grove-tinkerboard  
It is a module for evaluating Omron sensor D6T with Tinker Board and a sample program when using a module.

D6T is an infrared sensor that can measure the surface temperature of an object noncontactly by receiving radiant heat energy from the object with a thermopile element.
It can be used as a highly sensitive human sensor that can also detect stationary people.

## language
- [English](./README.md)

## Description
- grove_d6t.py  
Driver module for acquiring data from D6T via GrovePi+.

- sample_d6t.py  
It is a sample program that allows you to check the data acquired via the driver module on the console.

- sample_gui_d6t.py  
It is a sample program that enables you to visualize and check the data acquired via the driver module with graphs.

***DEMO:***  
When you run sample_gui_d6t.py, you can see the following graph.
